Hi Taylor,
Thank you for the updates.
 
The Vandy account sounds like it is proceeding as expected.
 
Fidelity made it a little harder with their decision to change the type of account to a rollover-IRA.
You will need to activate the new account
Then download an account statement/PDF and email it to me. (you may need to wait 30 days for them to generate a statement)
I can create the transfer paperwork from the account statement, and we can get it moved in about a week.
 
 
Once we see how this one goes, we can work on Mark’s.
